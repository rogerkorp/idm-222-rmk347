## Organization

Starting layer will consist of four folders:

- **Notes** for keeping track of information like this. I'll add in things here and there if I have a good idea for the project, or have the change up something midway through.

- **Content** for holding all of the images, audio, and video files that I will use throughout the entire project. Inside the content folder, there is one folder for each major section of the website, to keep track of what images go where.

- **HTML** & **CSS** for holding all of the HTML and CSS files that I will program throughout the entire project.

# Content Inventory
